fuck you in the highest order; save me from myself as the boys are dancing to a supposed ballad of death .  I guess the premonition of my death is still pending
Lilian always warned Saint about the shadows lurking beyond North’s forgotten streets, but he never believed her. Jay Maki, the mysterious newcomer, seemed drawn to the darkness like a moth to a flame. On a bitter night, they found themselves trapped inside an abandoned chapel where whispers crawled along the cracked walls.

Saint’s heart pounded as Lilian’s eyes darted nervously toward the peeling altar. “This place… it’s alive,” she murmured.

Jay smiled, but it was a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Alive or waiting.”

Suddenly, the floor beneath them groaned, splitting open like a maw. Cold hands reached from the abyss, grabbing at their ankles. Saint fought, but the shadows pulled harder.

“Don’t look back,” Lilian screamed as the darkness swallowed Jay whole.

Saint sprinted into the cold night, Lilian’s voice fading behind him. But as he gasped for air, a whisper curled in his ear—“You’re not free.”

He turned. Nothing but empty night.

Or was it?
